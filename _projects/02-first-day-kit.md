  FIRST DAY KIT is an app that enables companies to create a resource centre for employees on their first day of work. As the team lead for this project, I was responsible for choosing the art direction, designing the logo, creating the illustrations, and designing the UX.

    <h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
    <p>This was a class project with a real client who had a problem they wanted to solve. Unlike the other projects in our class, our client had no product in mind, simply a problem they wanted to solve and a catchy name: First Day Kit.</p>
    <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>The first day of a new job is always overwhelming and stressful. You don't know your coworkers. You're overloaded with new information. And sometimes you don't even know what to eat for lunch. On the employer's side, getting an employee's first day of work right is crucial for employee retention and productivity.</p>
    <h3>THE RESEARCH</h3>
    <p>We conducted a lot of research, looking into similar products and solutions to this problem. We also looked at the impact of how onboarding programs affect performance. For example, according to a study done by Aberdeen Group, formal onboarding increases the chance of keeping a new employee for at least 3 years by 69%. </p>
    <h3>TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
    <p>While organizations big and small can benefit from a First Day Kit, we decided with our client that this app was designed for small to mid-sized companies who may not have an HR department but are growing quickly and need a solution that is easy to use and scalable.</p>
    <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
    <p class="push-2">The solution we came up with was a web app that companies can customize for each new employee, containing the most pertinent information on the first day. It was a delicate balance between providing just the right amount of the important information, while keeping it light and stress-free. From our interviews, we learned that employees most want to know who their coworkers are, what events companies are hosting so that they can socialize, what to eat, and important information like health benefits. That is exactly what we provided in this app.</p>

<p class="project-text">The logo is a derivative of the letter F and the cross associated with first aid kits. The logo is modern and modular (it can be oriented in multiple ways), fitting the “kit” element of product.</p>
