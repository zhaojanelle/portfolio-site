FIRST DAY KIT is an app that enables companies to create a resource centre for employees on their first day of work. As the team lead for this project, I was responsible for choosing the art direction, designing the logo, creating the illustrations, and designing the UI/UX.

<h3>SERVICE: LOGO, ILLUSTRATIONS, UI/UX, BRAND IDENTITY</h3>

The First Day Kit logo was inspired by the cross in a first aid kit.


The first day of work is often overwhelming so it was important to create an
engaging and friendly space for the user. Original, hand-drawn illustrations
were used throughout to lend an inviting vibe.
