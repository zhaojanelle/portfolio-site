    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p class="pad-r">First Day Kit is an app that enables companies to create a resource centre for employees on their first day of work. As the team lead for this project, I was responsible for choosing the art direction, designing the logo, creating the illustrations, and designing the UX.</p>

    <h3>The Project</h3>
    <p class="push">This was a class project with a real client who had a problem they wanted to solve. Our client had no product in mind, simply a problem they wanted to solve and a catchy name: First Day Kit.</p>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p class="push">The first day of a new job is always overwhelming and stressful. You don't know your coworkers. You're overloaded with new information. And sometimes you don't even know what to eat for lunch. On the employer's side, getting an employee's first day of work right is crucial for employee retention and productivity.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p class="push">The solution was a web app that companies can customize for new employees. Figuring out what the app should include was finding a balance between providing all the necessary resources while keeping it light and digestible. We distilled it down to four essential elements for the kit: coworkers, food, events, and resources. Take a look for yourself.</p>

<h5>Logo</h5><hr>
<img class="img-flex load-hidden" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/first-day-kit-logo-explain.jpg" alt="First Day Kit logo explainer image"/>

<p class="project-text island-2">The logo is a derivative of the letter F and the cross associated with first aid kits. The logo is modern and modular (it can be oriented in multiple ways), fitting the “kit” element of product.</p>

<h5>Illustration</h5><hr>
