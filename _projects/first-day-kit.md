FIRST DAY KIT is an app that enables companies to create a resource centre
for employees on their first day of work. As the team lead for this project, I
was responsible for choosing the art direction, designing the logo, creating
the illustrations, and designing the UI/UX.

The first day of work is often overwhelming so it was important to create an
engaging and friendly space for the user. Original, hand-drawn illustrations
were used throughout to lend an inviting vibe.
