    Hello! I am a graphic designer based in Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in interaction and identity design.
  </p>

  <p class="push-2">At the core of my education, work, and interests lies my obsession with understanding human perception and using those insights to design something useful, delightful and meaningful.</p>
  <p class="push-2">Besides that, Iâ€™m into food culture. I make pottery in my spare time. And my cat is sitting on my hand as I type this.</p>
